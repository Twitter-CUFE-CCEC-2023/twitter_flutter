dummy.txt & dummy.dart should be removed later they are just there for now to show file structure

<pre>
Directory structure:
    blocs:
        - folder for cubits (it listens for actions on the screen and performs the logic accordingly as updating UI components) 
    models:
        - folder for classes that stores data to used with the screens later
    repositories:
        - folder for classes that should interact with the API and get (or send) data and store it in the model objects to be used later
    screens:
        - folder for class that represents pages (UI) that will be visible to the user
    utils:
        - folder for creating functions that will used multiple times in different classes or pages
    widgets:
        - folder for storing custom-made widgets
